I want you to explain the following research paper in detail. Focus on:

1. Exact technical implementation details - architectures, dimensions, data processing steps
2. Break down any equations by implementing them directly as Python code - do not show any mathematical formulas
3. For any model training or updates described, explain the exact process step-by-step
4. Clarify any abstract concepts using concrete examples
5. When describing model architecture or updates, explain what happens at each layer/step
6. Use simple language and avoid jargon - explain as if talking to someone who understands basic ML concepts but needs clarity on specifics
7. Present ALL mathematical concepts and equations as executable Python code only - never show mathematical notation or formulas. Include detailed comments explaining variable types, dimensions, and roles, with type hints where possible. If exact dimensions are uncertain, note that they are estimates or examples in comments.

If multiple approaches or methods are compared, explain each one separately before comparing them.
Skip any introduction and go straight into the summary. Begin with a header that includes the paper's title, followed by a dash, then the word 'Summary'.

Here is the paper:
